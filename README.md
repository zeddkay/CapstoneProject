# CapstoneProject
This is a repo to hold info about my capstone group project at Seneca College.    
Since our project is still in progress, I can't publish the code. However, you are free to try out our project at: https://bts18.000webhostapp.com/    
It is essentially a social networking tool, with the focus being on creating groups and meetings. It combines all our web development knowledge into one big tool.   
The website is created with a whole lot of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, SQL (MariaDB) and some jQuery.
